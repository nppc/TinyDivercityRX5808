# Tiny 5.8GHz Diversity VRX for EV100 Googles

## Proof of concept
- Bench test: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwpYg-zWEIs

## Calibration
- Power OFF VTX.
- Power ON Googles and then press button on tVRX.
- LEDs will make 5 short (100ms) blinks indicating, that lowest video signal detection in progress.
- When LEDs will stay lit, then power ON VTX.
- After about 2 seconds LEDs will make 5 long (900ms) blinks indicating that highest video signal detection in progress.
- When LEDs turn OFF for 2 seconds, then Calibration is done.
- Now tVRX will exit from Calibration mode and go to normal state.
